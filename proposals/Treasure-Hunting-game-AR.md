# Building an AR-based Treasure Hunting game in class

### Description
Recently, our school had STEM-days, two full days attributed to projects in the respective STEM-courses. Our Computer Science class decided to take on a project that first seemed utopian, but would turn out to become a huge success for us and our fellow students. Our idea was to build a web-based Treasure Hunt game using Augmented Reality. Over the course of time, we faced a lot of issues and challenges: Management-wise, we had to allocate the workload in a way that all students at their respective knowledge levels would be equally engaged and involved, and technically, we had to figure out how to get the Augmentations of the 3D-Hints to work.
In this talk, I will take you on a journey through our build process: How we utilized seasoned and emerging technologies like <a-frame> and express to build an AR-game for students to fight for higher rankings and exploring unknown places on their campus, but also what tasks we decided on to keep everyone on the team engaged without forcing them into their weaknesses.

Over the course of time, we faced a lot of challenges: Management-wise, we had to allocate the workload so that all students at their respective knowledge levels would feel involved, and technically, we had to figure out how to get the Augmentations of the 3D-Hints to work. In this talk, I will take you on a journey through our build process: How we utilized technologies like aframe and express to build an AR-game for students to competitively explore unknown places on their campus, but how we managed to keep everyone on the team engaged and happy.

### Timing

 - 5min What is AR?
 - 4min Explanation of the game concept

Building the game: 

 - 4min Sketching out and assigning the work tasks
 - 4min Frontend, a-frames and AR.js
 - 4min Backend
 - 3min Building the 3D models


- 5min Demo

Even though the end product might not be the most complex one, it was amazing for us to see pupils collaboratively trying to figure out what the hints could mean and later planning out routes and sprinting around the campus to achieve highscores.
